Thank you for playing my game!
In this game you'll be playing someone getting up and going to work... or are they?


Unfinished items:
-button to play audio
-audio file
-bar tracking "morality" of your decisions, i.e. going to work you vs skipping vs confrontation will have different, trackable movement in your route


Thank you to WebDevSimplified for the tutorial that guided the game dev process:
