Thank you for playing my game!
In this game you'll be playing someone getting up and going to work... or are they?


Unfinished items:

-button to play audio
-audio file
-bar tracking "morality" of your decisions, i.e. going to work you vs skipping vs confrontation will have different, trackable movement in your route

Known things that need fixing:

-the CSS and HTML don't load due to the prompting, reloading page doesn't allow for CSS/HTML to be viewed with prompt overlay when deployed even though it works when going through it on local machine. 

Would like:

-change delivery from prompting to instead have the game run through button clicks and be more user-friendly, would fix issue of HTML/CSS not loading after deployment and allow for longer storytelling. 
-story expansion
